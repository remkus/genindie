Introducing the IndieWeb to the Genesis Framework by adding Microformats to Genesis' output.

== Description ==

The IndieWeb is a wonderful movement, but it's lacking WordPress themes that are outputting the required Microformats 2.0 schema. This plugin does not aim to solve this issue for all WordPress themes. However, this plugin will turn any Genesis powered Child Theme into a fully IndieWeb ready theme.

Hope you enjoy it.


== Installation ==

Installation is as simple as installing any WordPress plugin

1. Upload `genindie.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
