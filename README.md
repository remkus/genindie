# GenIndie

The [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) is a wonderful movement, but it's seriously lacking WordPress themes that are outputting the required Microformats 2.0 schema. This plugin does not aim to solve this issue for all WordPress themes. However, this plugin will turn any Genesis powered Child Theme into a fully IndieWeb ready theme.

Hope you enjoy it.
